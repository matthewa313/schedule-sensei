/** Off overrides were spawned from the need to honor students' lunch period requirements. Creek requires all students to have a lunch period, either in 4th, 5th, or 6th period. (Typically, the registrar only allows Freshmen/Sophomores to have 4th or 6th lunch and Juniors/Seniors to have 5th lunch.)
 * We want to make sure that we only give students schedules that have a lunch period in either 4th, 5th, or 6th period, as these are the only schedules the registrar will allow them to have.
 * Practically, this means we can only generate schedules with an off in at least one of 4, 5, or 6. During the schedule generation process, we will throw out all schedules with not one of 4th, 5th, or 6th lunch.
 * This criterion would be simple enough to apply, but after conversations with students, it became clear that some wanted more control over the schedule generation process. For instance, Fr/So did not want the system to generate schedules with only 5th off. To honor this, we created the "required off override options."
 * This is a two-dimensional array where the ith entry represents a singular option. The first element of this entry is a String describing the required off override option. The second element is a list of offs which, if at least one is taken, satisfy the required off override option.
 * We also have an option "No lunch periods" that will generate all schedules, even if they don't satisfy the lunch period.
 * Obviously this only solves the lunch period problem, which is not a problem at all schools. There are also other scheduling issues that schools besides Creek face. This code is not especially generalizable and can be complex in areas, so a simpler solution is warmly welcomed.
